# PORTFOLIO
My CG Portfolio

this repository was created solely to show that I am capable of doing computer graphics. 

I apologize for the unstructured nature of this repository, because it contains projects made at different times.

Most of the contents of the OpenGL folder were made back in the school days

The DirectX folder contains the basics of DirectX 11 which I studied at the University

I'm Phoenix! Destinies can't break me.
And in the flames of fire not to burn my hopes…
The harder it gets, the stronger I get.
And I believe in the fulfillment of dreams, as before…
